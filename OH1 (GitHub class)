Dear students,

As per your request, we will have office hours on Thursday (28.02) at 6:30 PM.
I am going to answer your questions, so prepare them.

**Note:** Your first homework deadline as all furthers will not be extended, so try to solve your issues with downloading and coding.
Late submissions will not be accepted or graded.

Regards,
Lusine
