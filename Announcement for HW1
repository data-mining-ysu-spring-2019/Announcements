Dear students, 

1. Do not leave install.packages in chunk/script/file.

2. Using read.csv() is mandatory as I cannot run your code without it.

3. You should use the same data name in the whole file.

4. Add your interpretations outside of chanks without #s.

5. You need to knit your code before submitting, to make sure that your code works.

6. Try to be short in conclusions and interpretations!

7. Please, write your full names as a file name(eg. Lusine_Zilfimian.Rmd)

8. HTML HW file is illustrative, you need to download .Rmd and work in it.
